# FitnessTracker
This project is a web based solution designed to support individuals in their fitness
journey, from setting goals to achieving desired results. The app serves both fitness
enthusiasts and professional trainers and offers a range of features to meet their unique
needs. Users can create personalized profiles which contain their personal information,
fitness goals, and achievements. These profiles are for tracking progress and accessing
personalized recommendations. The app includes a diverse repository of workout routines
applicable to various fitness levels, goals, and preferences. Users can explore and choose
routines that match with their objectives, whether it's building muscle, losing weight or
improving cardio. In addition to workout routines, the app provides access to nutrition plans
designed to support users' fitness goals. These plans offer guidance on meal planning,
calorie intake and helping users make informed dietary choices. Users are able to track their
fitness progress over time such as workout sessions completed, calories burned, and other
relevant information. Based on users' fitness goals, preferences and progress, the app
delivers personalized recommendations for workouts and nutrition adjustments. These
recommendations help users stay motivated and make continuous progress towards their
goals. Professional trainers can use the web app to help trainees, creating customized
workout plans, nutrition plans, monitoring progress, and providing real-time feedback.
Trainers have access to trainee profiles and progress data, allowing for personalized
coaching and support. Lastly, an admin dashboard provides oversight and management
capabilities, allowing administrators to monitor user activity, generate reports, and ensure
data integrity and security.
